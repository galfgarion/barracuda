Diffuse shading and shadows work, but specular shading is not yet implemented.

The program handles multiple light sources and any number of spheres or planes,
but no other geometry.

The program outputs "standard" PPMs with magic number P6.
This format uses binary RGB values.

It draw differently on Windows vs. Linux.  Linux expects rgb byte ordering, 
while Windows expects gbr.  Very curious indeed. The program will output
the expected byte ordering for the system on which it is run/compiled.

The submitted PPM was generated on vogon, so it has rgb byte ordering.
